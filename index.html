          I'm a business student from Aurora, Ontario. I design and build products that work for people. Right now, I'm learning programming to bring my ideas to life.

        <p class="mt-4 text-2xl font-extralight text-gray-800">
          I believe that technology should be “humble servants, to be seen and heard as little as possible”. We have a toxic relationship with technology. We are slaves to technology and it gets better and better at coaxing us to serve its needs. 
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-2xl font-extralight text-gray-800">
          Technology is the only design domain where the product is the center of attention. Facebook deigns so tht its product can work better. It's not in Facebook's interest that you have a healthy relationship with them. Their goal is to mak eyou spend as much time as possible on it. Designers should get back to the roots of every other deign dicipline. Tech design has veered from all other design disciplines, where its purpose is to hack people's psychology rather than improve people's lives.
