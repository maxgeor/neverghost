			<p>I made a video series at Wavy called <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/joinwavy/channel/">Field Trip</a></strong> to uncover Toronto's hidden gems.</p>
      <p>Imagine Bon Appetit and a David Dobrik vlog had a baby. That's Field Trip.</p>
      <p>I was the...</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Producer</strong> (told coworkers I'd film them at lunch)</li>
          <li><strong>Director</strong> (yelled at coworkers)</li>
          <li><strong>Star</strong> (when I yelled at coworkers too much)</li>
          <li><strong>Editor</strong> (tried to make it watchable)</li>
          <li><strong>Cinematographer</strong> (shot it on my Pixel 3a)</li>
        </ul>
      <p>I basically did everything. It was a startup after all.</p>
      <p>It was super fun. I was making every shot up as I went along. Lunches became ~2.5 hours (intentional?)</p>
      <p>Here are couple things I learned:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Make fast-paced content</strong>. The best videos are <em>fast</em> - almost jarring. When I started Field Trip, everyone was talking about David Dobrik. I studied his videos and noticed something: They're fast, almost jarring. He'll sacrifice continuity, quality everything for entertainment. Like good design, cut everything that's not entertaining or relevent to the story. Our attention is short - make your cuts shorter.</li>
          <li><strong>Every clip is gold</strong>. Martin Scorsesi's teacher said that ever shot is a treasure. A shot could initially be garbage but in the edit is exactly what you need to tell the story.</li>
          <li><strong>Create spontaneously</strong>. The best moments in Field Trip weren't planned. A whole episode came from a squirrel trying to eat our food. </li>
          <li><strong>Story > Quality</strong>. I filmed on a phone... <em>VERTICALLY</em>... and people <em>still</em> loved it. Good stories compensate for everything. Sometimes, slightly worse quality + great story makes you feel closer to the star (call it the Casey Neistat Effect).</li>
          <li><strong>Contraints = Creativity</strong>. For each video, I had to turn ~30 low-quality shots into 2 minutes of high-quality entertainment. I had to be ultra creative in the edit, which lead to Field Trip's edit-heavy style. Without contraints, you lean towards normal.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't use IGTV</strong>. No-one wants to watch a vertical video for more than 30 seconds (unless it's <em>really</em> good).</li>
        </ul>
